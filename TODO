 - Implement algorithms
 - Automatic random generation of sample sets (different sizes)
 - Visualisation of sort algorithms in progress
 - Calculate complexity (space and time) from experiments -> see if matches theoretical complexity.
 - Graphs the time and space complexity or output in form that can be graphed in JS library.
